# Batch-Normalization-ML

This repository contains an implementation of Batch Normalization, a technique that improves the training of deep neural networks by normalizing layer inputs.

## Features:

Implementation of Batch Normalization for deep learning models.

Step-by-step code with clear explanations for easy understanding.

Demonstrates the impact of Batch Normalization on training speed and model performance.

Includes sample neural networks to show Batch Normalization in action.

Visualization of training progress (e.g., loss curves) to highlight performance gains.

## Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (if applicable)

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Applications:

Speeds up the training of deep neural networks.

Stabilizes learning by reducing internal covariate shifts.

Improves generalization and reduces the need for careful weight initialization.
